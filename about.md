## My interests
I have a passion for Linux and open source projects and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills. While I prefer open-source, I also enjoy learning how Active Directory works and how to use it to manage my company's network.  
## What I do
I am currently an IT apprentice, but I basically do everything. My goal is to become a systems administrator and maybe develop some tools along the way.  
## About this site
This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using a modified version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme based on [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
